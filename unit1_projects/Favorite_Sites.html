		<h1> My Top 3 Sites </h1>
		<h2> ESPN </h2>
			<p> To be honest the main reason why I like ESPN is probably because I am used to it. I have been using it for years and the layout has stayed relatively the same. Right when you enter the site your eyes are immediatly drawn to the slide show that shows everything that is happening today in the sports world. I would not change anythign with the layout again mainly because I am used to it but the content can be iffy sometimes. </p>
		<h2> USA Today </h2>
			<p> I only recently started looking at the web site but I love how it is layed out. They have pretty much ever topic possible (Sports, Tech, US News, World News, Weather, etc) and it is incredibly easy to navigate through them all. </p>
		<h2> Grantland Sports </h2>
			<p> Grantland primarily is in here for the content. They take a little different stance on covering sports news which I really enjoy. They often use advanced stats, add a little humor, and cover the smaller markets much more often than a power house like espn. The layout could be a little better as they often use nicknames in titles making it hard for new visitors to navigate the site. </p>
