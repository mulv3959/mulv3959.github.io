		<h2> Exercise 2 </h2>
			<p> I chose competition. I love to compete, it is what drives me everyday. Although you need to learn how to control a competitive attitude; I believe it is incredibly important in everyones life.  </p>
		<h2> Exercises 3 and 4 </h2>
			<p> In general, I try to live up to these values:
			Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree. I would give myself a 4. I do always try to do these values but it is pretty easy to stray away forget about them.</br> The last topic someone asked my advice on was my roommate asking me to read his philosphy paper and give him advice on how to fix parts of it. </p>
