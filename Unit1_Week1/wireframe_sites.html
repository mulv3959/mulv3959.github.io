			<p> It solves the problem of finding sports news around the web. It allows you to find pretty much any news you want to know from the sporting world. There is a lot happening visually with videos and pictures popping out at you but I am used to it so I enjoy the visual affects. </p>
			<h2><center> USA Today </center></h2>
			<img src="USAToday_wireframe/images.jpg" alt="USA Today wireframe">
			<p> This site solves the problem of finding recent news on pretty much any topic you are looking for. Things are kind of overly compact visually but it allows you to scroll through all the different sections of the site very easily.  </p>
			<h2><center> Grantland </center></h2>
			<img src="Grantland_wireframe/images.jpg" alt="Grantland wireframe">
			<p> Like ESPN this solves the problem of finding news on sports. Visually it is more difficult to find the section you are looking for because they use nicknames for sections sometimes. Also less interactive then a site like espn which makes it less visually entertaining for me.</p>
