				<h1> Favorite Websites </h1>
				<h2> ESPN </h2>
				<p> To be honest the main reason why I like ESPN is probably because I am used to it. I have been using it for years and the layout has stayed relatively the same. Right when you enter the site your eyes are immediatly drawn to the slide show that shows everything that is happening today in the sports world. I would not change anythign with the layout again mainly because I am used to it but the content can be iffy sometimes. </p>
				<h2> USA Today </h2>
				<p> I only recently started looking at the web site but I love how it is layed out. They have pretty much ever topic possible (Sports, Tech, US News, World News, Weather, etc) and it is incredibly easy to navigate through them all. </p>
				<h2> Grantland Sports </h2>
				<p> Grantland primarily is in here for the content. They take a little different stance on covering sports news which I really enjoy. They often use advanced stats, add a little humor, and cover the smaller markets much more often than a power house like espn. The layout could be a little better as they often use nicknames in titles making it hard for new visitors to navigate the site. </p>

				<h1> Self Reflection </h1>
				<h2> Exercise 1 </h2>
				<p> When you think of the times in your life where you’ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?

				Accomplishment Accountability Achievement Ambition Challenge Close relationships Commitment Community Competence Competition Confidence Control Coolness under fire Cooperation Courage Creativity Credibility Decisiveness Effectiveness Efficiency Enthusiasm Excellence Excitement Faith Fame Free time Freedom Friendships Growth Having a family Health Influence Inner harmony Inspiration Knowledge Leadership Loyalty Meaningful work Mentorship Merit Money Persistance Personal development Physical challenge Pleasure Public Purity Quality Recognition Reputation Responsibility Will-power </p>
				<h2> Exercise 2 </h2>
				<p> I chose competition. I love to compete, it is what drives me everyday. Although you need to learn how to control a competitive attitude; I believe it is incredibly important in everyones life.  </p>
				<h2> Exercise 3 </h2>
				<p> In general, I try to live up to these values:
				Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree. I would give myself a 4. I do always try to do these values but it is pretty easy to stray away forget about them.
				<h2> Exercise 4 </h2>
				<p> The last topic someone asked my advice on was my roommate asking me to read his philosphy paper and give him advice on how to fix parts of it. </p>

				<h1> ID’s v Classes </h1>
				<p> ID’s and Classes are used so you can identify a section of a website with a name of your choosing. Later, when you would like to add color or a design to this section, you “call” on it by using the name you chose above. When designing a website this can be very useful. So what is the difference between an id and a class? 
				<h2> ID </h2>
				<p> An id can only be used to identify <strong> ONE </strong> section. I like to think of my own personal ID (or drivers license) when trying to remember what an id is in html/css. My driver’s license only identifies me, I cannot use it to identify anyone else because it is specific to me. Similar to how an id works in html/css; it can only be used identify one specific section.</p>
				<h2> Class </h2>
				<p> A class on the other hand can be used to identify multiple sections that share a similar property. I usually think of a school classroom, lets say a Math Class. Each person within this math class is a different section of the website. So the every student in the classroom can fall under the same class, “math class.” </p>

				<h1> Pairing </h1>
				<h2> What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges? </h2>
				<p> I really enjoy pairing. It is much easier to solve a problem by bouncing ideas off of each other. I worked well with my partner, Simon Gondeck. We have known eachother for a while so we have pretty good chemistry. </p>
				<h2> Was something particularly fun or rewarding? </h2>
				<p> After hour or so of working on the code actually getting it to work is always very rewarding. Especially since I went into this group pairing session not knowing really any Java. I enjoy looking back at my first steps after I'm done. I always find it interesting seeing how simple it can be after you really understand what you are supposed to do.  </p>
				<h2> Was something frustrating and difficult for you? </h2>
				<p> I did not know much Java going into the pairing session this week. Because of that it made it very difficult. My partner and I really struggled for the first 45 minutes getting the concepts down. But this made getting our code to work that much more rewarding. </p>
