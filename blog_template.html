				<h1> Favorite Websites </h2>
				<h2> ESPN </h2>
				<center><img src= "ESPN_wireframe.jpg" alt="espn wireframe"></center>
				<p> ESPN solves the problem of finding sports news around the web. It allows you to find pretty much any news you want to know from the sporting world. There is a lot happening visually with videos and pictures popping out at you but I am used to it so I enjoy the visual affects. </p>
				<h2><center> USA Today </center></h2>
				<center><img src= "USAToday_wireframe.jpg" alt= "USA Today wireframe"></center>
				<p> This site solves the problem of finding recent news on pretty much any topic you are looking for. Things are kind of overly compact visually but it allows you to scroll through all the different sections of the site very easily.  </p>
				<h2><center> Grantland </center></h2>
				<center><img src= "Grantland_wireframe.jpg" alt= "Grantland wireframe"></center>
				<p> Like ESPN this site solves the problem of finding news on sports. Visually it is more difficult to find the section you are looking for because they use nicknames for sections sometimes. Also less interactive then a site like espn which makes it less visually entertaining for me.</p>

				<h1> ID’s v Classes </h1>
				<p> ID’s and Classes are used so you can identify a section of a website with a name of your choosing. Later, when you would like to add color or a design to this section, you “call” on it by using the name you chose above. When designing a website this can be very useful. So what is the difference between an id and a class? 
				<h2> ID </h2>
				<p> An id can only be used to identify <strong> ONE </strong> section. I like to think of my own personal ID (or drivers license) when trying to remember what an id is in html/css. My driver’s license only identifies me, I cannot use it to identify anyone else because it is specific to me. Similar to how an id works in html/css; it can only be used identify one specific section.</p>
				<h2> Class </h2>
				<p> A class on the other hand can be used to identify multiple sections that share a similar property. I usually think of a school classroom, lets say a Math Class. Each person within this math class is a different section of the website. So the every student in the classroom can fall under the same class, “math class.” </p>
